*The most important key takeaway from Digital Literacy is that there is very limited supply of great programmers. 
*When considering how to hire, a business owner needs to think very seriously about what task it asking of a programmer.
*If asking to build a program that can scale to millions of users, be prepared to spend significant amounts of money on a great team who have worked together prior.
*If asking to build a simple app, still insist on a team that can iterate quickly. They will be pricier, but will save time and headaches.
