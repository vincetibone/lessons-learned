It is unlikely in my career that I will be in a Product Manager role for a tech firm or managing a team of developers full-time. The main reason I took this course is in the event I want to pursue an entrepreneurial endeavor. I want to know the best practices when hiring and negotiating with developers to build the supporting technology infrastructure, such as the website, app, back-end, etc.  One of the key takeaways from the course that should hopefully save me money and improve the quality of my technology is to **hire programmers on an hourly basis and not a fixed price contract**. 

The primary reason hourly contracts are superior, as the client, is that the developer usually doesn’t know exactly how long the proposed project is going to take. As such, if you force the developer to commit to a price at the onset, he is going to error on the side of caution to their benefit. If he thinks the project will take 50 hours to complete, he will likely quote a fixed price contract for the equivalent of 70 hours of work to cover himself in the event the project takes longer than expected. 

In most cases, a fixed priced bid will end of costing more than an hourly contract would. The client feels more comfortable with the **fixed price contract because it is essentially a form of insurance; however, insurance is not free though**. Additionally, a fixed price contract doesn’t guarantee the product will be up to your quality expectations and therefore, there is actually less expense assurance than you expect. However, while hourly contracts are usually preferable, if the project at hand has a clear defined business rules, and functionality specification, it may be beneficial to hire a programmer on a fixed fee and contingent upon execution of milestone deliverables. One last factor to consider is where you are hiring a team that has experience working together or creating a new team of individually selected programmers. Teams with experience working together will likely be more efficient and thus bill less hours.

The common concern for the hourly contract structure, as was mine, is that the programmer will take longer than necessary and try to bill you for the most possible hours. This is actually much less of an issue than expected as good programmers are in high demand and want to work on challenging, interesting projecting. They are more likely to take the next exciting opportunity than risk their reputation by over-billing the client. 

Below are the links to two blogs discussing the hourly versus fixed price issue that I found interesting:
